    - "- **START** - Powers on the instance."
    - "- **STOP** - Powers off the instance."
    - "- **RESET** - Powers off the instance and then powers it back on."
    - "- **SOFTSTOP** - Gracefully shuts down the instance by sending a shutdown command to the operating system.
      If the applications that run on the instance take a long time to shut down, they could be improperly stopped, resulting
      in data corruption. To avoid this, shut down the instance using the commands available in the OS before you softstop the
      instance."

      then powers the instance back on."

                  your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots;
                  however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run
                  every time an instance boots; not only after the initial
                  LaunchInstance call.
                - "The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot
                  volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE
                  script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume
                  over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the
                  following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN:
